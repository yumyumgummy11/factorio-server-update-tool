# factorio-server-update-tool
 
simple factorio server update tool all you have to do is give it the file path and it should work
the file path will not be into your server directory. EX: "/home/user/desktop/vanillaFactorio" would be a correct file path where as "/home/user/desktop/vanillaFactorio/factorio" would be incorrect because it is entering the servers directory. so basically just to the folder the server is stored in.
